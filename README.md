# AsyncRoutineManager - Advanced Goroutine Management for Go

## Overview

**AsyncRoutineManager** is a lightweight yet powerful framework for managing asynchronous operations in Go.
Instead of using the native `go` keyword to start goroutines, developers can leverage this framework to gain enhanced **visibility, monitoring, and logging** for their concurrent operations. 
The framework helps analyze and troubleshoot issues related to the **number of running goroutines, their execution duration, and enforce time limits** to prevent runaway processes.

## Features

✅ **Goroutine Visibility** - Track and monitor all active goroutines in real-time.
✅ **Logging & Debugging** - Log goroutine execution details for troubleshooting.
✅ **Time Limits & Deadlines** - Enforce execution timeouts for goroutines.
✅ **Graceful Shutdown** - Ensure proper cleanup and resource deallocation.
✅ **Concurrency Analysis** - Detect goroutine leaks and performance bottlenecks.

## Use Cases

- **Prevent Goroutine Leaks** - Ensure that long-running goroutines don’t persist indefinitely.
- **Monitor System Performance** - Track concurrency patterns in real-time.
- **Improve Debugging & Logging** - Gain insights into async execution flow.
- **Graceful Shutdowns** - Clean up background tasks on application exit.
